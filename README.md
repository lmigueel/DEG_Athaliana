Abstract:

Due to the immense complexity of plant genomes, transcriptomic analysis plays a relevant role in understanding the biological mechanism, since in addition to providing evidence of how the organism responds in a given situation, RNA sequencing can also be used to aid genomic information. The analysis can be divided into four steps: i) quality analysis and data trimming; ii) alignment of fragments to the reference; iii) quantification of transcripts; and iv) differential expression analysis. In general, only the differential expression analysis step (iv) is performed in R language, but in this chapter we present a different version, in which external software was executed by commands in R. As an example was used an experiment of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism with a short life cycle, a well studied genome and easy to manipulate in laboratory.
